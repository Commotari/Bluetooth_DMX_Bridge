# Bluetooth_DMX_Bridge

## General Idea
The idea behing this open source project is to make a bridge between bluetooth and DMX to control lights etc. from a mobile android device via bluetooth.

## Initial usecase
The initial usecase is the Strandgut culture club in Linz, Austria, where we have a small stage with a few lights, that have dip-switches and XLR IN/OUT connectors to interface with the DMX standard.
* adjusting the lights via dip-switches is very cumbersome, not ideal for a daily fast adjustment
* buying DMX controllers is expensive and involves equipment that eats up space in our culture club
* we would like to have a small mobile solution that everyone can use (artists, volunteers who serve at the bar, ...)
* an android mobile phone seems to be a good solution, could be used directly on stage for live events from the artists, or next to the audio mixer in the back of the room at a live event used by the audio engineer.
